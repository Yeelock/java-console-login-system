# Console Login System (Java)

This is a simple console-based login system written in Java.

## What it does
- Ask user for name and year of birth
- Check if age is at least 18
- Let user set a password (with confirmation)
- Generate a captcha using random numbers
- Verify user input before login success

## Why I made this
I built this project to practice:
- Scanner input handling
- while loops and condition checking
- basic user input validation
- using Random in a real scenario

## What I learned
- Why String comparison must use .equals()
- How Scanner.nextInt() affects nextLine()
- How to keep asking user until input is correct

## Known limitations
- Password is not encrypted
- Data is not saved
- Console only (no GUI)
- Does not validate unrealistic birth years.

This project is made for learning purposes.
